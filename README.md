# Introduction
Suicide rate is a serious public problem. It is the act of intentionally causing oneâ€™s own death. The world health organization estimated that over 700,000 dies due to suicide every year. Many suicide happens impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with the stress of life. suicide was the second leading cause of death among the 25-35 year sold globally in 2016. Hence it is quite clear that suicide is a global concern that should be analyzed.
Hence, this project contains a case study, analysis and visualization of Suicide rate of some part of the country.

## Aim
My aim of doing this project is to get valuable and meaningful insight of how the Suicide Rate has increased or decreased across the countries. 

# Resources and code used
**The dataset i used was gottem from Kaggle, which includes (27820 Rows and 10 Columns) and the columns were made of:**
* Country
* year
* sex
* age 
* generation
* suicides_no : The number of suicide.
* population : the Total number of people.
* suicides/100k pop: The number of the death by suicide for a total 100.00 deaths
* country-year
* HDI for year : The Human Development index of the year
* gdp_for_year($) :Domestic Product per capital  
* gdp_per_capita($) : Gross Domestic Product divided by midyear population
* The analyis was done using Python programming language, on jupiter notebook for both analysis and visualization.

**Packages used:**
* PANDAS: i used pandas to import my dataset and handle the messy data , NUMPY: was used it to work on array and for mathmatical operations, SEABORN and MATPLOTLB was used for the visualization 

# Data Cleaning
After downloading the data from GitHub, I needed to clean the data in order to  perform an Exploratory data analysis. First i checked for missing data and discovered there were some missing data i needed to fix which i did using pandas. I renamed some columns which were misspelt and replaced the space in the columns with underscore,i also dropped a duplicated column.I detected outliers and removed it. 

# Exporatory Data Analysis
I looked at the distribution of the data and the value counts for various categorical values. After analyzing the data using python.
**I grouped some columns inorder to get an insight of the data and visualize** 
1. Group by year and Suicide : At what yeat was the suicide number high?
2. Group by Age and Suicide_no : What age commits Suicide more? 
3. Group by Country and population : What Country has the highest number of population?
4. Group by Year and Suicide_pop : In what year was the suicide_pop high?
5. Group by Sex and Suicide_no : what Gender commits suicide more?
6. Group by Generation ad Suicide_no : Which Generation commited Suicide more?

# Data Visualization 
After exploring the data, i then visualized it on Jupiter notebook using python and also on power BI.
